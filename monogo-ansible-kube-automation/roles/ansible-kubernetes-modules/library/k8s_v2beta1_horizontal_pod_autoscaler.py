module: k8s_v2beta1_horizontal_pod_autoscaler
short_description: Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler
description:
- Manage the lifecycle of a horizontal_pod_autoscaler object. Supports check mode,
  and attempts to to be idempotent.
version_added: 2.3.0
author: OpenShift (@openshift)
options:
  annotations:
    description:
    - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may
      be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are
      not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
    type: dict
  api_key:
    description:
    - Token used to connect to the API.
  cert_file:
    description:
    - Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  context:
    description:
    - The name of a context found in the Kubernetes config file.
  debug:
    description:
    - Enable debug output from the OpenShift helper. Logging info is written to KubeObjHelper.log
    default: false
    type: bool
  force:
    description:
    - If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated,
      and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.
    default: false
    type: bool
  host:
    description:
    - Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.
  key_file:
    description:
    - Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  kubeconfig:
    description:
    - Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection
      options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to load the default
      configuration file from I(~/.kube/config.json).
    type: path
  labels:
    description:
    - Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope
      and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
    type: dict
  name:
    description:
    - Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
      although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate
      name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and
      configuration definition. Cannot be updated.
  namespace:
    description:
    - Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace
      is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.
      Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this
      field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.
  password:
    description:
    - Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).
  resource_definition:
    description:
    - Provide the YAML definition for the object, bypassing any modules parameters
      intended to define object attributes.
    type: dict
  spec_max_replicas:
    description:
    - maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler
      can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas.
    aliases:
    - max_replicas
    type: int
  spec_metrics:
    description:
    - metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired
      replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used). The
      desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target
      value and the current value by the current number of pods. Ergo, metrics used
      must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa. See the individual
      metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must
      respond.
    aliases:
    - metrics
    type: list
  spec_min_replicas:
    description:
    - minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler
      can scale down. It defaults to 1 pod.
    aliases:
    - min_replicas
    type: int
  spec_scale_target_ref_api_version:
    description:
    - API version of the referent
    aliases:
    - scale_target_ref_api_version
  spec_scale_target_ref_kind:
    description:
    - Kind of the referent;
    aliases:
    - scale_target_ref_kind
  spec_scale_target_ref_name:
    description:
    - Name of the referent;
    aliases:
    - scale_target_ref_name
  src:
    description:
    - Provide a path to a file containing the YAML definition of the object. Mutually
      exclusive with I(resource_definition).
    type: path
  ssl_ca_cert:
    description:
    - Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API.
    type: path
  state:
    description:
    - Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to
      C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if
      parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted,
      if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating
      dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list
      contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge
      is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type)
      are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).
    default: present
    choices:
    - present
    - absent
  username:
    description:
    - Provide a username for connecting to the API.
  verify_ssl:
    description:
    - Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates.
    type: bool
